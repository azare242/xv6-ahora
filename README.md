Certainly! Here's an example of a README file you could use for your GitHub repository for the xv6-riscv project with the added system call `kfreemem` and a user application to utilize it:

```
# xv6-riscv with kfreemem System Call

This repository contains a modified version of the xv6-riscv project, a simple operating system for the RISC-V architecture. In this version, we have added a new system call called `kfreemem` to free pages of OS memory. Additionally, a user application is provided to demonstrate the usage of this new system call.


## Background

xv6-riscv is a teaching operating system developed for MIT's 6.S081 course. It is a reimplementation of the classic UNIX Version 6 (v6) operating system, designed to run on RISC-V architecture. The project provides a simple and easily understandable codebase, making it a suitable platform for learning operating system internals.

In this repository, we have extended xv6-riscv by adding a new system call, `kfreemem`, which allows freeing OS memory pages. This system call can be used by user applications to explicitly release memory allocated by the operating system.


## Usage

After successfully building and running xv6-riscv with the modified kernel, you can utilize the new `kfreemem` system call in user applications.

To demonstrate the usage, we have included a sample user application named `kfreemem.c`.

To run the sample application, follow these steps:

Inside the xv6-riscv shell, run the compiled user application:

   ```bash
   $ kfreemem
   ```

Please note that this is just a simple example to demonstrate the usage of the `kfreemem` system call. You can modify and extend the user application as needed for your own projects.
